Goal: Train random forests for budgets (50, 100, 150,...) to predict whether a run has an optimal swtiching point at that budget. 
      Input for these random forests are ELA features computed by the run up to that point 

Steps:
1. Create ELA files for budgets - done
2. Add to the files whether a run has an optimal switching point at that point or not
3. Train random forests for budgets, evaluate their performances

Additional steps that might lead to something:
1. Optimize random forests
2. Compare predictions with heatmap (also prediction certainty)
    2.1 For that, create heatmaps with lower resolution (so every 50 evals)
3. More random forests (higher resolution grid)
4. Not try to predict if something is an optimal switching point, but use a regression model to predict the "optimality" at a certain point,
   this could then very well be compared to the heatmap!
